# Foodie-Fun Front-End

## Tech Stack
- React
- Redux

### Description
This was a build week project for lambda school.
The idea of this app is to allow people a place to post pictures, ratings, and comments about restaurants and their meals.
My objective here was to build the front-end portion of the FoodieFun web app.
This was done by creating a SPA using React.js with React-Router, and Redux for global state management.
All endpoints were provided by Lambda School through an API published on Heroku.
